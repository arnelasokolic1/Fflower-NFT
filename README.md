# Flower-NFT

## Overview

I created a **Flower NFT** as a part of a Blockchain Fundamentals course. The image and metadata for this NFT are stored on **IPFS** using **Pinata**, ensuring that the content is decentralized and permanently accessible.

### NFT on OpenSea

## IPFS Storage

- **Metadata**: The metadata for the NFT (like title, description, and properties) is also stored on IPFS.
